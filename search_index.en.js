It’s used just like the cat command:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nYou can set up an alias to substitute your regular cat command with bat:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\njq / xq  / yq / htmlq / jless / fq\nLet’s employ an API to retrieve our present location details, such as country, city, and more.\nThe API that we’re going to use is: http://ip-api.com\nJSON:\nTo get the result in JSON format, we need to call http://ip-api.com/json address.\nSo, for example, we want to show the country, city, and region name of the current machine:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nXML:\nTo the same data result in XML format, we need to call http://ip-api.com/xml/{IP} address.\nLike the previous call but in XML format:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nYAML:\nIt’s similar to the jq command:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nHTML:\nIn this case, we’re planning to retrieve a webpage and extract both the title and an element identified by its ID.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nFor a more interactive experience when dealing with large JSON and YAML files, it’s advisable to use jless.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nYou can make it work with XML as well, by piping the result of XML to xq:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nBinary:\nfq\nWe can get a binary file information with the similar way in the jq command.\nIn this example, we’re going to get all tags of a binary file and requesting for one of them:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nhexyl\nFor reading a binary file, hexyl is the go-to tool:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nYou can change the base to binary:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\ntokei\nIn order to get an aggregated information about source codes, you need Tokei:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nYou can use it with -o flag to define the output format.\nFor example, we want to get only list of Golang files:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nProcess\nNow, let’s move to list of commands to work with processes:\nprocs\nI opted for procs over ps mainly because it displays the bound ports of each process.\nConfiguration can be done through a TOML file.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nbtop\nThis is part of my morning routine—running this command every day to keep an eye on my system.\nBased on the documentation:\n\n    Resource monitor that shows usage and stats for processor, memory, disks, network and processes.\n\n\n\nYou can configure your btop by putting the config file in the ~/.config/btop/btop.conf path.\nFor example, this is my config file:\n\n    \n    btop.conf\n    \n    \n\n\n\nkmon\nSimilar to btop, but only for monitoring the Kernel.\nBased on the documentation:\n\n    kmon provides a text-based user interface for managing the Linux kernel modules and monitoring the kernel activities.\nBy managing, it means loading, unloading, blacklisting and showing the information of a module.\nThese updates in the kernel modules, logs about the hardware and other kernel messages can be tracked with the real-time\nactivity monitor in kmon. Since the usage of different tools like dmesg and kmod are required for these tasks in Linux,\nkmon aims to gather them in a single terminal window and facilitate the usage as much as possible while keeping the functionality.\n\n\n\nRecently, while using kmon, I noticed an error in my Linux kernel related to writing to a pipe.\nThis could serve as a starting point to investigate and identify the root cause of the issue.\nctop\nSimilar to btop or kmon, but only for monitoring the containers.\nBased on the documentation:\n\n    ctop provides a concise and condensed overview of real-time metrics for multiple containers,\nas well as a single container view for inspecting a specific container. ctop comes with built-in support for Docker and runC;\nconnectors for other container and cluster systems are planned for future releases.\n\n\n\nI don’t use this tool often since I primarily employ Docker for testing and deploying local services.\nHowever, when needed, it proves helpful in easily monitoring container usage.\nsysz\nThis tool combines fzf and systemctl, simplifying the process for users to manage daemons effortlessly.\nUtilizing fzf allows for quickly locating the desired daemon and promptly taking action through systemctl commands.\nFor instance, you can swiftly locate and restart the Docker service using this tool.\nConclusion\nNumerous CLI tools are available on the internet to help you accomplish your objectives.\nIf you’re aware of other tools worth exploring, please share them with me.\nI’m getting ready to put together the second part of this post.\n","id":"https://0t1.me/blog/2023/10/21/handy-cli-utilities-part-1/","title":"handy command-line utilities - part 1"},"https://0t1.me/blog/2023/11/18/handy-cli-utilities-part-2/":{"body":"This marks the second installment in a series about useful CLI utilities.\nIn this article, I’ll delve into additional command-line tools that can enhance your productivity in the terminal.\nWhile the first article covered text and file processing tools, as well as process management,\nthis one will focus on topics like searching within files and directories, along with project management.\nFile and directory\nTo effectively manage files and directories, it’s beneficial to utilize a well-designed CLI tool that presents information in a clear and easily understandable format.\nexa\nExa is the ls command replacement.\nIt displays a list of files and directories, akin to the ls command, but with added features such as colorized outputs,\nGit integration, icons, support for a tree view, and more.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nTo simplify usage and avoid the need to remember all the flags, you can create an alias, similar to what I’ve done:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nz / zoxide\nIf you’re seeking a convenient way to navigate to a directory without specifying the entire path, consider using z or zoxide.\nThere have been many instances where I needed to swiftly jump into a directory with a distinctive name, and these solutions proved helpful.\nWhile both z and zoxide can address the primary concern, if you’re seeking specific features,\nyou’ll need to examine each project individually for more information.\nI personally use zoxide, and in this example, I was searching for my “dotfiles” directory. I simply mentioned “dot” and here is the output:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nSearch &amp; Lookup\nEnhancing productivity in the terminal involves finding the best matches in files and directories.\nIn this section, we’ll discuss some of the ones I find most useful.\nfzf\nYou might be familiar with it, fzf is a fuzzy finder designed to assist you in swiftly and interactively locating your desired file or directory path.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nWhen I’m engaged in a project, I often need to swiftly locate files, read snippets from them, and if it’s the correct file, open it in Neovim.\nFzf serves as the ideal solution. It recursively indexes your directory, allowing you to search for a file while simultaneously previewing its content.\nTo enhance this process, you can utilize fzf’s --preview parameter and pair it with the bat command.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nSo, as you see, the bat command proves to be quite useful when working with fzf.\nAdditionally, you have the option to modify the default command behind the fzf command.\nPersonally, I opt for fd due to its speed and efficiency:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nI’ve also configured f and o aliases in my zsh_aliases file\nfor swiftly accomplishing what I need:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nYou can leverage fzf to perform text searches, such as finding the PID of a process:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nmcfly\nFor those accustomed to using ctrl-r to search their terminal history, consider using mcfly for a more convenient and enhanced experience.\nPersonally, I opt for fzf to search my history.\nripgrep-all\nMany individuals utilize ripgrep for recursive searches, and to extend the search capabilities to include PDFs, Ebooks, archived, compressed,\nand other file types, you can make use of the ripgrep-all package.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nbat-extras\nbat-extras encompasses various commands related to bat.\nOne notable example is batgrep, which combines ripgrep and the bat command to enhance the output for a better experience:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nOnce installed, you can utilize its commands, such as batman and batdiff.\nast-grep\nThis is one of my favorite tools that facilitates searching in your source codes for more precise results based on\nthe Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).\nFor example, consider a scenario where you have a collection of code containing the word “func” (indicating a Golang function definition)\nsomewhere in your README file. If you were to use the grep or ripgrep commands, they might return instances of the “func” word in the README file,\nwhereas you’re specifically searching for functions in your source code.\nIn this instance, I’m searching for any type of function that takes no parameters:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nNow, I’m searching for functions with only one parameter:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nAs the result indicates, ast-grep is a perfect choiece for these use cases.\nProjects\nNow, let’s delve into project management in the terminal, which requires a combination of several commands.\nIf you believe that simply using “mkdir” or “git clone” will suffice, I would advise against it, as it can become chaotic\nwhen dealing with numerous projects, making maintenance a challenging task.\nghq\nThe ghq tool aids in project management by simplifying the workspace path introduction.\nWhen you need to clone a project, you can provide the URL to ghq, and it automatically clones the project to the appropriate path.\nghq allows you to view a list of projects, create a new repository, and can be seamlessly combined with other tools we’ve discussed to swiftly\nsearch and navigate to your desired project.\nLet’s clone a project:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nAs the output indicates, it stores the project in the /home/mort/Workspaces/github.com/neovim/neovim path without me explicitly specifying it.\nNow, let’s see the list of projects:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nWe can employ fzf to search for a project and cd to its directory:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n    GHQ_ROOT is a crucial variable that the ghq command is attentive to.\nSTherefore, it’s essential to set it to your workspace path. What I’ve done was export GHQ_ROOT=“$HOME/Workspaces”.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this article, we delved into displaying files and directories with enhanced, human-readable information through colorized output.\nWe discussed how to locate a file or directory using fzf, and also explored a method for finding a function in our project with context,\navoiding unrelated results.\nFinally, we concluded with a project management approach, combining various commands with the ghq tool.\n","id":"https://0t1.me/blog/2023/11/18/handy-cli-utilities-part-2/","title":"handy command-line utilities - part 2"},"https://0t1.me/blog/2023/12/21/enforce-adherence-of-derived-classes-to-parent-signatures-in-python/":{"body":"When we’re developing an object oriented systems in Python, there are often instances where we have to create abstract classes.\nThese classes define a basic structure that we expect other parts of the code to implement.\nor instance, in the context of databases, we create an abstract class that contains fundamental structure for a database class.\nThe derived classes then need to implement the abstract methods to form a complete structure.\nThe challenge arises when a derived class doesn’t follow the expected signature of the abstract class.\n\nAbstract class:\n\n    \n    base.py\n    \n    \n\n\nDerived classes:\n\n    \n    derived.py\n    \n    \n\n\n\nTest:\n\n    \n    test.py\n    \n    \n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nIn this particular scenario, everything functions smoothly without any issues.\nHowever, as a project expands and more individuals become involved, there is a possibility that some might not follow the\nestablished standards exactly.\nPython itself doesn’t prevent this.\nConsider this implementation of the MySQL class, which completely deviates from the signatures of the abstract class:\n\n    \n    derived.py\n    \n    \n\n\nPython test:\n\n    \n    test.py\n    \n    \n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nAs you can see, Python didn’t check the signature at all.\nAllowing this structure to merge into your codebase would violate the established standards.\nNow, can we compel everyone to adhere to the abstract class signatures?\nThis is where the abcmeta project comes into play.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nThe only thing needs to be changed in your code, is in your abstract class file:\nfrom:\n\n    \n    base.py\n    \n    \n\n\n\nto:\n\n    \n    base.py\n    \n    \n\n\n\nThis library then examines and ensures that all signatures align with the abstract class.\nNow, let’s run the previous example and see what will happen:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nThe error message clarifies that the signature differs from that of the abstract class, and explains with all details.\n\n    Additionally, it’s important to know that abcmeta utilizes metaclasses\nimplying that it examines the class when the class is defined!\n\n\nTherefore, if you modify the test code to something like this:\n\n    \n    test.py\n    \n    \n\n\nThen you’ll get the same error result.\nSo, by using these kinds of libraries in Python, we can proactively avoid future errors by forcing derived classes to follow\nthe abstract class signatures, similar to strong-typed programming languags.\n","id":"https://0t1.me/blog/2023/12/21/enforce-adherence-of-derived-classes-to-parent-signatures-in-python/","title":"Enforce adherence of derived classes to parent signatures in Python"},"https://0t1.me/blog/2024/09/01/practical-awk/":{"body":"Sometimes, we need to run a series of commands or API calls, gather their outputs, and store them in an organized way.\nFor example, imagine we have a CSV file and want to use multiple cURL commands to fetch information about the data in it.\nThen, we might need to clean up and format the results from each step and use them as inputs for other cURL calls or commands.\nIn this article, I’ll show how to handle these real-life scenarios using a powerful tool called AWK.\nWhat is AWK\nBased of Wikipedia:\n\n    AWK is a domain-specific language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool.\nLike sed and grep, it is a filter, and is a standard feature of most Unix-like operating systems.\n\n\n\nLet’s say you have a sample file like this:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nAnd you want to filter the output with this query: “Get the sum of the second and third columns for all records where the third column is greater than or equal to 10.”\nYou can easily do this with AWK:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nAnd the output will be:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nLet’s get started!\nIn our scenario, we have a CSV file, and we want to go through multiple steps to process the data.\nSample input CSV file:\n\n    \n    input.csv\n    \n    \n\n\nSample output CSV file:\n\n    \n    output.csv\n    \n    \n\n\nWe need to follow these steps to achieve the output:\n\nCheck the website status by looking at the HTTP code.\nRetrieve the website’s title by parsing the &lt;title&gt; tag.\nGet the website’s content type by reading the Content-Type header.\nFind the website’s IP address.\nUse the IP address from step 4 to determine the geo location.\nUse the geo location from step 5 to find the phone code for that area.\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\nTo create a final clean code, we should define each step as a separate function.\nThis makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.\nPrepration\nFirst, we need to create an AWK file with a different delimiter since the input is a CSV file:\nWe’ll set FS to \",\" to parse based on commas, and OFS to an empty string to ensure the output has no extra spaces around each element.\n\n    \n    pipeline.awk\n    \n    \n\n\nNow, we need to ignore the first line as well, since it’s the header line:\n\n    \n    pipeline.awk\n    \n    \n\n\n\nNext, we need a normalizer to clean up our input addresses and prepare them for processing:\n\n    \n    pipeline.awk\n    \n    \n\n\n\nAlso, make sure to grant execute permission to the file:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nNow, let’s run our code by passing the input file to make sure it works as expected:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nAnd the output will be just what we expected, showing only the Origins column:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n    Sometimes, the path to your awk might be different from what’s mentioned in this article.\nTo make the script work, you can call the awk command directly:\n\n\n\nNow, let’s get started with the flow.\nStep1 (Fetch Status)\nBased on the flow, we need to fetch the website’s status. To do this, we can use a curl command to get the HTTP code of the website:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nWe use -s to make curl silent, and -o to discard the website content.\nWithout these options, curl would print the entire content, which could interfere with our other processing logic.\nNow, let’s implement this inside the AWK file:\n\n    \n    pipeline.awk\n    \n    \n\n\n\n    Don’t forget to include \",\" (comma) between variables in the print statement, as we want the output in CSV format!\n\n\nLet’s run it to see the results:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nGreat! Now let’s move on to the next step: fetching the title of the website.\nStep2 (Fetch Title)\nTo complete this step, we need a tool to process HTML content. Here, we use htmlq for that purpose.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nNow, let’s add this inside the AWK file:\n\n    \n    pipeline.awk\n    \n    \n\n\nTo parse various types of website content, you’ll need different tools.\nFor more information about these tools, check out my other post: Handy Command-Line Utilities - Part 1.\nStep3 (Fetch Content-Type)\nNow, let’s fetch the website’s Content-Type value using curl, grep and cut:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nWe use the -I flag to fetch only the headers.\nInside the AWK file:\n\n    \n    pipeline.awk\n    \n    \n\n\nStep4 (Find IP Address)\nNow, it’s time to find the IP address of the website. There are several options for this, but I’ve chosen the dig command.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nSince the dig command requires the HOST, not the full website address, we need to remove the http and https prefixes.\nAWK has the sub function for finding and replacing strings based on regex. Let’s use it to implement our function:\n\n    \n    pipeline.awk\n    \n    \n\n\nLet’s run it to see the results:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nAwesome! We’ve got some results now!\nLet’s move on to the next step: finding the location of the IP address we obtained with the dig command.\nStep5 (Find GEO Location)\nHere, I’ll use the ip-api service: http://ip-api.com/json/{IP}.\nThe output of this URL is in JSON format. So, we can use the jq command to parse it:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nNow, let’s add this inside the AWK file:\n\n    \n    pipeline.awk\n    \n    \n\n\nNow, let’s see the output:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nStep6 (Find Phone Code)\nThe last step in the flow is to find the phone code for that location.\nI’ll get this information from the countrycode.org website by parsing the HTML output:\n\nBefore implementing this logic, we need to parse the location to extract only the country name and convert it to lowercase, as the website requires.\nAWK’s built-in split and tolower functions can help us achieve this.\nSo, let’s implement the step:\n\n    \n    pipeline.awk\n    \n    \n\n\nLet’s run it:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nFinalization\nNow that we have the results we’re looking for, the only remaining step is to prepare it for output.\nAs we wanted to achieve this output structure:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nWe need to include a header in our output file, so we should add a print statement in the BEGIN section:\n\n    \n    pipeline.awk\n    \n    \n\n\n\nSo, all in one place:\n\n    \n    pipeline.awk\n    \n    \n\n\nFinally, run the script and store the results in output.csv.\nYou can use csview to present the CSV file.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nConclusion\nAs we’ve seen, AWK is a very handy and useful tool for working with data.\nIf you have a series of data processing tasks, you can use AWK to achieve the desired output.\nFor example, in one of my real cases, I needed to call multiple APIs to gather information, such as fetching user details and then retrieving user-registered processes, and etc.\nI hope you find this article useful!\n","id":"https://0t1.me/blog/2024/09/01/practical-awk/","title":"Practical AWK"},"https://0t1.me/blog/2024/09/14/git-useful-commands/":{"body":"As a software engineer using Git almost every day, it’s essential for me to master this tool to efficiently manage my code and tasks.\nIn this discussion, I’ll go over some Git commands that have significantly boosted my productivity during development and maintenance.\nAlias\nGitignore\nYou’re probably already familiar with it, but that’s not the focus here.\nInstead, I’ll show you how to generate a gitignore list for your project.\nThe main purpose of a gitignore file is to prevent certain file types from being committed or tracked in your repository.\nThere’s an API available that allows you to generate a custom gitignore file based on your needs: https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/$args.\nThis can be a quick and convenient way to create a gitignore list tailored to your project.\nI believe the best approach is to create a simple function that utilizes the API for generating a custom gitignore file.\nThis way, you can easily automate the process:\nfor bash:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nfor fish:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nNow, you can use it easily:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nCommands\nNote\nSometimes you might need to add a note about a commit or mention something related to it without altering the commit itself.\nFor instance, you might want to note that a commit was tested by X, Y, and Z.\nIn such cases, you can use git note to add this additional information.\nFor example, if you want to add a note to a commit indicating that it needs a better implementation due to resource constraints:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nOutput in git log:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nThis way, you can keep track of important details or improvements needed without modifying the original commit.\nand to remove the note if you want:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nWorktree\nWhen you’re refactoring, developing, or making changes in your current branch,\nyou might need to debug or check something in the production version of the system. With git worktree,\nyou can quickly create a separate working directory for the desired branch without stashing or altering your current code.\nThis allows you to test and debug in a separate environment and easily remove it when you’re done.\nIt’s a straightforward and efficient solution!\n\n    \n    \n\n\nNow, go to the debug directory (cd debug) and perform whatever tasks or testing you need to do.\nOnce you’re finished, you can easily remove the directory by:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nCherry pick\nYou’ve probably heard this before, and I don’t want to bore you with the usual details.\nMy goal here is to give you a practical idea of when to use cherry-picking.\nFor example, you might get a pull request (PR) that gets rejected or canceled due to internal decisions.\nOr maybe a PR gets merged into the development branch, but you only need one specific commit from it to fix something in production.\nThat’s where cherry-picking can be really useful.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nLet’s review what we have so far:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nAdd Patch\nSometimes, when making changes to a file, you might only want to commit a few specific lines rather than the entire file.\nIn the past, I’d use git stash, manually apply the changes I wanted, and then add the file.\nNow, though, I can use git add -p to selectively stage only the lines I want to commit, skipping the rest of the file.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nNow, it provides an interactive environment where you can commit only the specific parts you want:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nHere, we only want to add the last line, print(\"goodbye\\n\");, and leave the rest unchanged.\nAs shown in the last line, git add -p provides a menu that lets you choose how to proceed.\nInitially, you can add all the changes, but since we only want to include a specific line, you type s to split the current hunk into smaller chunks.\nYou can type ? to see the full menu of options:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nAfter typing s, it now shows us this:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nBut that’s not what we’re looking for. Let’s type n, which means “do not stage this hunk”, to move to the next chunk.\nWe’ll continue doing this until we find the part we want to add.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nNow we type y, which means “stage this hunk”. That’s it! Next, let’s run git diff --staged to review what we’ve added:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nThis is exactly what we wanted.\nIf you run git status, you’ll see that the file appears in both staged and non-staged sections, as we only selected a part of the file for our upcoming commit.\nBisect\ngit bisect is a valuable tool for debugging.\nIt allows you to navigate through past commits and run tests or commands to identify which commit introduced a problem.\nBy testing a range of commits, you can pinpoint the exact commit where the issue began.\nFor instance, if you notice a memory leak in the code on the main branch and want to identify which commit introduced it,\nyou can use git bisect to help pinpoint the source. In C/C++, tools like Valgrind can be used to detect the memory leak.\nFor example:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nWhen I compile and run the code, it works fine, but it has a memory leak that never gets released. To track it down, we use Valgrind:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nAs indicated, there are 2 allocs and 1 frees, with the LEAK SUMMARY section providing more details on the issue.\nNow, imagine your code was working perfectly, but suddenly, when you try to push your changes, you discover a memory leak.\nYou need to figure out which commit introduced the issue to determine if you can fix it with a patch or if other versions are affected as well.\nLet’s first take a look at our commit history:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nThe only thing we know is that the current branch, which we’ll call “bad,” has the issue.\nTo find the problematic commit, we need to identify a “good” commit to set our testing range.\nIn this case, I’ll use the “Init repo” commit, 1f223b694dac72ebbf595aafbb81132c3e0de014, as our reference for the “good” commit.\nNow let’s get started:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nLook, we’ve identified the commit that introduced the memory leak! Let’s examine the changes:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nAs soon as the __attribute__((cleanup(free_char))) was removed, we started encountering the memory leak.\nFinally, run the reset command to return to the master branch:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nRev-List\nOne of my favorite ways to recover a deleted file is using this method.\nFor example, if I removed a config or source code file from the project six months ago and now need to see what was in\nthat file to copy a single line for use in my current branch, this approach is perfect.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n-1 refers to just the first commit.\n--all includes all the commits.\n\nNow, we need to checkout that commit hash to recover the file.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nNow, if you check the output of git status:\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nHere’s an interesting thread on Stack Overflow about restoring a deleted folder in a Git repository: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30875205/restore-a-deleted-folder-in-a-git-repo\nConclusion\nGit is an incredibly useful tool for tracking changes in complex scenarios.\nFor example, you can find only changed files using git grep, trigger pipelines by committing with an empty message, and more.\nIt all depends on your needs. I recommend reading the official documentation, and if you like,\nyou can set up a bunch of aliases in your shell or Git to streamline your workflow and make processes easier to handle.\n","id":"https://0t1.me/blog/2024/09/14/git-useful-commands/","title":"Git Useful Commands"},"https://0t1.me/blog/2025/01/20/cpp-rust-fii-inter-stack-communication-concerns/":{"body":"In this article, I’ll discuss internal communication aspects of C++ and Rust by using FFI to address two important concerns.\nCommunication Concerns\n\nHow will data be transferred between stacks?\nHow does the owner release the memory?\n\nI will focus on two key concerns: first, effiecent data transfer between C++ and Rust, and second: determing ownership of memory allocation and resource management.\nPassing data\n\nPointers\n\nWhen passing data between different stacks, as you all you, using pointers is the most efficent option.\nPointers allow us to reference the exact memory address, avoiding data duplication of passing by value.\nMemory management\n\nEach stack is responsible:\n\nRelease the allocated resources.\nProviding release functionalities for use by other stacks.\n\n\n\nRegarding the memory management, each stack is responsible for releasing its own allocated memory, either directly or by providing functionality that can be invoked by other stacks.\nExample\nThis is the directory structure of the example:\n\n    \n    \n\n\nIn this example, we have a Rust project functioning as a library and C++ as the top-layer stack.\nHere we have a print_and_return function that takes a char pointer, converts it into Rust’s string data type, process it, and finally generates a new string as output, retriving its memory address.\n\n    \n    src/lib.rs\n    \n    \n\n\nAs mentioned, the stack should either release its resources or provide a release functionality for the top-layer stack.\nIn this case we defined a free_string function, allowing the top-layer stack to release the memory allocated by Rust by calling this function, which targets the char pointer address.\nThis is the C++ example, that uses the Rust library to call the print_and_return function inside Rust, retrive its output, and perform any desired operations, afterward, it releases the memory allocated by Rust by calling the free_string function.\n\n    \n    main.cpp\n    \n    \n\n\nFor resources allocated in C++, since we are using the standard C++ library for the string data type, the allocated resources will be automatically released when the string goes out of scope.\nAfter checking the resources by Valgrind tool, we observed 4 allocations and 4 releases, indicating that there are no memory leaks.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nHere is the output of the sample code, which demonstrates that the C++ string points to the same address as the Rust string, and vice versa.\n\n    \n    \n\n\nThis confirms that we have achieved an efficient way to transfer data between the two stacks.\nThis is also the way to compile the project, if you wish to do so:\n\n    \n    Makefile\n    \n    \n\n\nAlso, the Cargo file:\n\n    \n    Cargo.toml\n    \n    \n\n\nNote\n\n    You can release memory allocated by Rust in C++ using free(result), but this is not recommended.\nRust’s memory management includes safety checks and allocation context that C++ lacks. Using free in C++ can lead to errors or undefined behavior in Rust.\nSimilarly, C++ resources should not be freed directly in Rust.\nIt’s safest to let each language manage its own resources.\n\n\n","id":"https://0t1.me/blog/2025/01/20/cpp-rust-fii-inter-stack-communication-concerns/","title":"C++ Rust FFI Inter-Stack Communication Concerns"},"https://0t1.me/dotfiles/":{"body":"Here is my configuration for the environment.
