In this discussion, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over some Git commands that have significantly boosted my productivity during development and maintenance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Practical AWK</title><link>https://0t1.me/blog/2024/09/01/practical-awk/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0t1.me/blog/2024/09/01/practical-awk/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sometimes, we need to run a series of commands or API calls, gather their outputs, and store them in an organized way.
For example, imagine we have a CSV file and want to use multiple cURL commands to fetch information about the data in it.
Then, we might need to clean up and format the results from each step and use them as inputs for other cURL calls or commands.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to handle these real-life scenarios using a powerful tool called AWK.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enforce adherence of derived classes to parent signatures in Python</title><link>https://0t1.me/blog/2023/12/21/enforce-adherence-of-derived-classes-to-parent-signatures-in-python/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0t1.me/blog/2023/12/21/enforce-adherence-of-derived-classes-to-parent-signatures-in-python/</guid><description>&lt;p>When we&amp;rsquo;re developing an object oriented systems in Python, there are often instances where we have to create &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_type">abstract classes&lt;/a>.
These classes define a basic structure that we expect other parts of the code to implement.
or instance, in the context of databases, we create an abstract class that contains fundamental structure for a database class.
The derived classes then need to implement the abstract methods to form a complete structure.
The challenge arises when a derived class doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow the expected signature of the abstract class.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>handy command-line utilities - part 2</title><link>https://0t1.me/blog/2023/11/18/handy-cli-utilities-part-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0t1.me/blog/2023/11/18/handy-cli-utilities-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>This marks the second installment in a series about useful CLI utilities.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll delve into additional command-line tools that can enhance your productivity in the terminal.
While the &lt;a href="https://0t1.me/blog/2023/10/21/handy-cli-utilities-part-1/">first article&lt;/a> covered text and file processing tools, as well as process management,
this one will focus on topics like searching within files and directories, along with project management.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>handy command-line utilities - part 1</title><link>https://0t1.me/blog/2023/10/21/handy-cli-utilities-part-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0t1.me/blog/2023/10/21/handy-cli-utilities-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>As I heavily depend on the terminal for a range of activities such as browsing, handling files, coding, and converting videos,
I wanted to share the collection of tools I use regularly. This blog post is divided into three sections, and in the final part,
I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through my shortcuts and aliases.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
